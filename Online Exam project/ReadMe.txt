Hi,
This is a sample code to handle online exam with timer. You can specify the time in javascript file on the top of the file. Where i diclare global variables for timer. set the time there.

DATABASE :

1. Create one blank database named as TestExam or if you want different then you can but when execute the query you have to set the name of the database.
2. Execute the query which is enclosed with this project.
3. Add minimum 10 questions and answers on to that table.
4. You must specify the option number in the correct field. For Example :  if you answer is Option1 then set as 1.

About RUN :

1. Now Change the connection string in web.config file.
2. Set the database server name with instance in datasource then database name and password.
3. Then specify the timer in count.js file. I set it to 59 second if yo want more you can set in Hour, minute and second field


Thank You.
